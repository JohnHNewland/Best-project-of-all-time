    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    <value>It can’tbecan’tbecan’tbe. What the hell is this, I don’t get it. Why do I have to go through this? Who do you take me for? I am the Sin Archbishop of Greed, Regulus Corneas. The most satisfied existence in the world! Indisputably, the most established individual, an existence without any wavering aspects! It’s supposed to be like that, so why do I have to go through this?! Don’t mess around, this isn’t a joke. Each and every one of them, what’s wrong with them to make them accept such nonsensical absurdities as if those are a matter of course? That man, that woman, and that Knight too, just because I showed a little mercy, they’re getting too ahead of themselves, if I had been serious from the beginning, then I could have had torn them apart in bits and pieces, aren’t they misunderstanding their own power? Because you can shamelessly misunderstand things that are, from my point of view, hilariously wrong, is why I hate getting involved with others! Obnoxious, annoying, irritating, infuriating, vexing, dirty, unsightly scum. I’ve always, always been doing well, for years, decades, centuries, like this, for all that time, I have been the one most faithfully serving as a Sin Archbishop, compared to anyone else. When I was first chosen as a Sin Archbishop and received this Witch Factor, I killed them all, the father who despite his poor earnings was plagued with a bad drinking habit, the mother who prattled on endlessly complaining day and night, and the greedy brothers who used to ravenously eye the portion that rightfully belonged to me, I killed them all, the villagers who looked at me like I was an idiot too, the townsman who had pushed me into such an house in that hopeless village too, the inept heads of the country who had carelessly abandoned the village to that state in the first place too, I tore them all apart into bits and pieces, and when everything was gone, I finally noticed a way I could live without them! I don’t need anything. Everything’s just annoying. I’m already satisfied. It’s not that I didn’t have it, I just didn’t need it. Unlike the intrusive scum, I’ve never needed anything. Despite that, giving me something, doesn’t that mean that, from the outside, from your point of view, that you looked at me and thought that I was a pitiful, lacking existence? Everyone who wants to impose unneeded things on me should be killed, so only those who will leave the satisfied me alone should be allowed into this world. No matter who, those fuckers who just preached about their selfish nonsense. Does anyone have the right to pity me? Who has the right to pity me and drive me to despair? As if I would let them. I don’t need anything, and neither did I ask for anything. A father who despite his poor earnings was plagued with a bad drinking habit and yet still occasionally bought gifts for me is scum better off dead. A mother who prattled on endlessly complaining day and night while saying obvious things like “Apologies for troubling you” is scum better off dead. The greedy brothers who, despite ravenously eyeing the portion that rightfully belonged to me, used to split part of their share when my food got spilled are scum better off dead. Stop you fuckers, being arbitrarily kind towards me. Being kind, it must mean you think I’m below you, that you’re looking down on me. Someone who looks the goddamn down on others, especially someone who looks down on their family, it’s natural they’d be hated. It’s natural that they’re dead. It’s not my fault. I’ve done nothing wrong. It’s your fault, you, you pitypitypity me, treat me like I’m pathetic, and leave me all alone. Have a taste of what it’s like to be made to feel like the most worthless person in the world. Surrounding me should only be those who don’t pity me. Those who do pity me should disappear from the world. I hear laughter. You’re looking at me, aren’t you? You looked at me and laughed, didn’t you? What’s so laughable about me? What did you see in me that made you laugh? All of them laughing and laughing, a bunch of powerless scum who are only good at running their mouths. Why does my heart have to break so much because of them? Don’t stand in my way, don’t obstruct me, don’t pity me, I’m not the pitiable one, it’s you, you’re the one helpless and ignorant but still filled with Greed! You have to crawl throughout your entire life just to satisfy your incomplete selves, you’re the one pitiable and greedy! I’m different, I’m not like that, I don’t want anything. Devoid of desires as I am, I’m better than your incomplete selves. Don’t pity me. The truth is that you’re jealous of me, envious of me, you admire me and because you can’t reach me, you’re just running your mouth off. That’s right, that must be right, it’s so obviously right. Wait, wait, just wait. Just stop. Don’t look at me, don’t say my name, don’t talk about me. Good or bad, just stop it, don’t pay attention to me, ignore me and leave me alone. Even though a complete existence has a heart that should not be able to be trampled on, how come the likes of you are so insistent on interacting with me? I cannot comprehend it in the slightest. Both you and I are different people. Even thinking of getting something in return by taking risks, no matter how you think about it, it could never be reasonable, it would always be a mistake. You’re sick in the head. Calm down and think about it and you should be able to understand. All humans except me are just floating in a fever. Asking of others, the very fact that it’s understandable is meaningless, it should be easy to comprehend that it’s both useless and irresponsible. Those words you keep repeating like idiots, love, friendship, trust, they’re all illusions. And those foolish idiocy reproductive activities are the utmost disgusting acts. I don’t understand what it means. For what are you doing this? Whether companion or mother or child, although you may decorate with words such as “family”, they’re entities separate from myself, and what does whether those things are dead or alive have to do with me? If they continue to live when I die, I’d cease. If they’re dead while I live, then that would only mean my continuation. Love and affection only make it so that people cannot be independent. People are independent in the first place. Out of concern for those who operate under such delusions, and because being looked down by others is foolish, I found companionship by gathering good-looking women, and in order to not be betrayed by those I had chosen, I sought only virgins, what more do you want of me? Don’t perform such a selfish act. Infringing on me to this extent, but still asking whether you can infringe on me even more? To think you’ve hit this point! To think your thoughts could be so twisted! Inflicting all this upon me, what more could you even demand of me? Just what do I have to do to not be pitied? The most pitiful person in the world, or whatever! I’m not going to let a whore plagued with such vulgar Greed to give me a reason such as wishing to connect with the one she loves! </value>
